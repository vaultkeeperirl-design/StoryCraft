# StoryCraft: A Universal TTRPG Portal

Welcome to **StoryCraft**, a modular tabletop roleplaying game system designed to bring any story or idea to life—from high-magic fantasy to gritty sci-fi and everything in between.

StoryCraft is built on a "Modular Engine" philosophy. The core rules provide a robust foundation for storytelling, while "Setting Plug-ins" add the specific flavor and mechanics needed for your chosen world.
