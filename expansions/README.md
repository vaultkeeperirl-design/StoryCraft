# StoryCraft Expansions

Expansions are optional modules that add specific mechanical depth to any StoryCraft game. Unlike Settings, which provide a world, Expansions provide new ways to play.

## 🧩 Planned Expansions
*   **Advanced Tactical Combat**: More detailed rules for positioning, cover, and specialized maneuvers.
*   **Political Intrigue**: Systems for handling factions, reputation, and large-scale social conflict.
*   **Magic & Mysticism**: Deep dive into various magic systems for any setting.
