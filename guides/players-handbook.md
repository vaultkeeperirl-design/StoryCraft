# Player's Handbook

This guide is for anyone playing a character in a StoryCraft game.

## 🏁 Quick Start
1.  Read the [Core Mechanics](../core-engine/core-mechanics.md).
2.  Follow the [Character Creation](../core-engine/character-creation.md) guide.
3.  Check with your GM about which [Setting](../settings/) you are using.

## 🎭 Roleplaying Tips
*   **Describe your actions**: Don't just say "I roll to hit." Describe how your character swings their sword or tries to bypass the security terminal.
*   **Embrace Failure**: In StoryCraft, a failed roll is just a new direction for the story.
*   **Collaborate**: Work with your fellow players to create awesome moments.
