# Core Mechanics

## The Core Check
When a character attempts a task with an uncertain outcome, they perform a **Core Check**.

**Formula:** `[Attribute] + [Skill Rank Bonus] + 1d20 vs Difficulty Class (DC)`

Skills provide a bonus based on your training (Untrained +0, Trained +2, Expert +4, Master +6). See the [Core Skill List](./skills.md) for details.

*   **Natural 20**: A critical success.
*   **Natural 1**: A critical failure (or "complication").

## Setting the Difficulty
The Difficulty Class (DC) represents how hard a task is to accomplish for an average person. The GM sets the DC based on the complexity of the action, not the character's skill.

| Difficulty | DC | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Trivial** | 5 | Routine tasks under pressure. Rarely rolled. |
| **Easy** | 10 | A competent person would succeed most of the time. |
| **Moderate** | 15 | Requires focus and training. The standard challenge. |
| **Hard** | 20 | Difficult even for experts. Significant chance of failure. |
| **Heroic** | 25 | Near-impossible feats. Requires mastery and luck. |
| **Legendary** | 30 | Miraculous achievements. The stuff of myths. |

### Opposed Checks
When a character's action is directly opposed by another character (e.g., sneaking past a guard), both parties roll.
*   **Active vs. Reactive**: The active character rolls against the reactive character's result.
*   **Tie goes to the Defender**: If the results are equal, the status quo is maintained (the sneaker is spotted, the grapple fails).

### Circumstantial Modifiers
Sometimes external factors make a task significantly easier or harder.
*   **Advantage**: Roll 2d20 and take the **higher** result. Use this when the character has a major situational benefit (e.g., high ground, perfect tools, help from an ally).
*   **Disadvantage**: Roll 2d20 and take the **lower** result. Use this when the character is hindered (e.g., darkness, slippery surface, suppressed fire).

## Conflict Resolution
Conflict in StoryCraft isn't just about combat. It can be a heated debate, a high-speed chase, or a magical duel.

For detailed rules on Initiative, Turns, Actions, and Damage, see the [Conflict Resolution](./conflict-resolution.md) guide.

## Health and Stress
Characters track two types of wellbeing:
1.  **Vitality**: Physical health and stamina.
2.  **Resolve**: Mental fortitude and emotional stability.

For full rules on Health, Damage, and Recovery, see the [Conflict Resolution](./conflict-resolution.md#health--recovery) guide.
