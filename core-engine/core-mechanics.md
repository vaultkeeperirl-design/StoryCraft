# Core Mechanics

## The Core Check
When a character attempts a task with an uncertain outcome, they perform a **Core Check**.

**Formula:** `[Attribute] + [Skill] + 1d20 vs Difficulty Class (DC)`

*   **Natural 20**: A critical success.
*   **Natural 1**: A critical failure (or "complication").

## Conflict Resolution
Conflict in StoryCraft isn't just about combat. It can be a heated debate, a high-speed chase, or a magical duel.

### Rounds and Turns
During a conflict, time is tracked in **Rounds**. Every character gets one **Action** and one **Move** per turn.

## Health and Stress
Characters track two types of wellbeing:
1.  **Vitality**: Physical health and stamina.
2.  **Resolve**: Mental fortitude and emotional stability.
