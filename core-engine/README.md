# StoryCraft Core Engine

The Core Engine contains the universal rules for the StoryCraft TTRPG system. These rules are setting-agnostic and form the foundation of any game played with this system.

## 📄 Core Documents

1.  **[Introduction](./introduction.md)**: What is StoryCraft? The basic philosophy of the game.

## 🛠️ The Philosophy
StoryCraft uses a modular approach. The Core Engine handles the "How" of the game, while Settings handle the "What" and "Where".

*   **Universality**: A character from a Fantasy setting should be mechanically compatible with a Sci-Fi setting.
*   **Narrative First**: Mechanics are designed to support and drive the story, not just simulate physics.
*   **Simplicity**: Easy to learn, but with depth provided by modular expansions.
