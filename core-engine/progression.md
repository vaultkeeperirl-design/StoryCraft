# Character Progression

Characters in StoryCraft grow in power through experience. As they overcome challenges, they gain **Levels**.

## The 10-Level Scale
StoryCraft uses a 10-level progression system, divided into three tiers of play.

### Tiers of Play
*   **Novice (Levels 1-3)**: Competent adventurers dealing with local threats.
*   **Heroic (Levels 4-7)**: Powerful figures influencing the fate of kingdoms or sectors.
*   **Legendary (Levels 8-10)**: Masters of their craft, challenging gods or reshaping reality.

## Progression Table

| Level | Vitality / Resolve | Benefit |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **1** | Base | **Character Creation** (See [Character Creation](./character-creation.md)) |
| **2** | +1 | **Skill Advancement** (Train a new skill or upgrade Trained to Expert) |
| **3** | +1 | **Attribute Boost** (+1 to one Attribute) |
| **4** | +1 | **New Trait** |
| **5** | +1 | **Skill Advancement** (Train a new skill or upgrade Trained to Expert) |
| **6** | +1 | **Attribute Boost** (+1 to one Attribute) |
| **7** | +1 | **New Trait** |
| **8** | +1 | **Mastery Unlocked** (Can upgrade Expert to Master) |
| **9** | +1 | **Attribute Boost** (+1 to one Attribute, Max +5) |
| **10** | +1 | **Legendary Trait** |

## Mechanics of Growth

### Health Increases
At every level up (including level 1 to 2), your maximum **Vitality** and **Resolve** both increase by **1**.

### Skill Advancement
When you gain a Skill Advancement:
*   **Train a New Skill**: Choose an Untrained skill (+0) and make it Trained (+2).
*   **Expertise**: Choose a Trained skill (+2) and make it Expert (+4).
*   **Mastery (Level 8+)**: Choose an Expert skill (+4) and make it Master (+6).

### Attribute Boost
Increase one of your four Attributes (Might, Agility, Intellect, Will) by **+1**.
*   **Cap**: You cannot raise an Attribute above **+5**.

### Traits
Traits are special abilities or feats defined by your Setting or Class.
*   **Standard Trait**: A focused benefit (e.g., "Cleave", "Hacker", "Silver Tongue").
*   **Legendary Trait**: A world-altering power available only at Level 10.
