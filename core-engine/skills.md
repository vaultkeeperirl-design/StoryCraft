# Core Skills

Skills represent a character's specialized training and experience. They provide bonuses to Attribute checks, reflecting focused knowledge or practice.

## Skill Ranks
Proficiency in a skill is measured in **Ranks**. Each rank adds a fixed bonus to the relevant Attribute check.

*   **Untrained (+0)**: No special training. You rely solely on your raw Attribute.
*   **Trained (+2)**: Basic competence. You have learned the fundamentals.
*   **Expert (+4)**: Professional level. You are skilled and experienced.
*   **Master (+6)**: Legendary capability. You are among the best in the world.

## The Core Skill List
Skills are categorized by their primary Attribute. However, the GM may call for a skill to be used with a different Attribute if the situation warrants it (e.g., using *Intimidation* with *Might* instead of *Will*).

### Might Skills
*   **Athletics**: Climbing, swimming, jumping, and feats of strength.
*   **Brawl**: Unarmed combat and grappling.

### Agility Skills
*   **Acrobatics**: Balance, tumbling, and escaping restraints.
*   **Stealth**: Hiding, moving silently, and blending in.
*   **Thievery**: Picking locks, disabling traps, and sleight of hand.
*   **Ranged Combat**: Archery, throwing, and firearms.
*   **Melee Combat**: Fighting with hand-held weapons.

### Intellect Skills
*   **Investigation**: Searching for clues, deducing information, and research.
*   **Lore**: Knowledge of history, magic, science, or culture.
*   **Medicine**: First aid, surgery, and diagnosing ailments.
*   **Survival**: Tracking, foraging, and navigating the wilderness.
*   **Tech**: Using, repairing, or hacking technology (setting-dependent).

### Will Skills
*   **Insight**: Reading people, detecting lies, and sensing motives.
*   **Intimidation**: Coercing others through fear or threats.
*   **Persuasion**: Convincing others through logic, charm, or diplomacy.
*   **Deception**: Lying, disguising oneself, and misleading others.

## Using Skills
When you perform a **Core Check** relevant to a skill you possess, add your **Skill Rank Bonus** to the roll.

**Formula:** `[Attribute] + [Skill Rank Bonus] + 1d20`

*Example: A character with Agility +3 and Trained (+2) in Stealth attempts to sneak past a guard. They roll 1d20 + 3 + 2.*

## Modularity
Settings and Expansions may add new skills to this list (e.g., *Piloting* for Sci-Fi, *Spellcraft* for Fantasy). If a specific skill is not listed, use the most relevant existing skill or default to an Attribute check.
