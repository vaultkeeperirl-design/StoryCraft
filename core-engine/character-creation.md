# Character Creation

Building a character in StoryCraft follows five simple steps:

## 1. Concept
Define who your character is in one sentence.
*Example: "A disgraced knight looking for redemption."*

## 2. Attributes
All characters have four primary attributes:
*   **Might**: Physical strength and endurance.
*   **Agility**: Speed, balance, and precision.
*   **Intellect**: Knowledge, logic, and perception.
*   **Will**: Force of personality and mental grit.

### Assigning Scores
At character creation, choose one of the following arrays to assign to your attributes:

*   **Standard Array**: +2, +1, +1, +0
    *(A well-rounded hero with a clear strength.)*
*   **Specialist Array**: +3, +0, +0, -1
    *(Highly focused talent, but with a significant weakness.)*
*   **Versatile Array**: +1, +1, +1, +1
    *(Competent in everything, master of nothing.)*

### Attribute Scale
| Value | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| **-1** | **Weak** (Below average human capability) |
| **+0** | **Average** (Standard human capability) |
| **+1** | **Above Average** (Talented or trained) |
| **+2** | **Exceptional** (Peak human potential) |
| **+3** | **Heroic** (Beyond normal limits) |
| **+4** | **Superhuman** (The realm of monsters and machines) |
| **+5** | **Legendary** (Godlike power) |

## 3. Skills
Choose skills that represent your character's training and experience.

*   **Select 2 skills** from the [Core Skill List](./skills.md) to start as **Trained (+2)**.
*   All other skills start as **Untrained (+0)**.

Your choice of skills should reflect your character's background and role in the party.

## 4. Derived Stats
Calculate your secondary statistics based on your Attributes and Skills.

*   **Vitality** (Physical Health): `20 + Might`
*   **Resolve** (Mental Health): `20 + Will`
*   **Defense** (Combat DC): `10 + Agility + Combat Skill Rank`
    *   *Combat Skill Rank* is your rank in a relevant defensive skill (e.g., *Acrobatics*, *Melee Combat*).

## 5. Traits
Traits are unique abilities or background elements that give you a mechanical edge in specific situations.

## 6. Gear
Start with basic equipment suitable for your setting.

## 7. Leveling Up
As you play, your character will gain experience and grow in power. For rules on advancing beyond level 1, see **[Character Progression](./progression.md)**.
