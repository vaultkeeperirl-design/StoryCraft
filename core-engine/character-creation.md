# Character Creation

Building a character in StoryCraft follows five simple steps:

## 1. Concept
Define who your character is in one sentence.
*Example: "A disgraced knight looking for redemption."*

## 2. Attributes
All characters have four primary attributes:
*   **Might**: Physical strength and endurance.
*   **Agility**: Speed, balance, and precision.
*   **Intellect**: Knowledge, logic, and perception.
*   **Will**: Force of personality and mental grit.

## 3. Skills
Choose skills that represent your character's training and experience. Skills are added to Attribute checks.

## 4. Traits
Traits are unique abilities or background elements that give you a mechanical edge in specific situations.

## 5. Gear
Start with basic equipment suitable for your setting.
