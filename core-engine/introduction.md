# Introduction to StoryCraft

## What is StoryCraft?
StoryCraft is a flexible, modular tabletop RPG system. It is designed to be lightweight enough for quick one-shots but robust enough for multi-year campaigns.

## The Goal of the Game
In StoryCraft, players collaborate with a Game Master (GM) to tell a compelling story. The rules exist to provide tension, resolve uncertainty, and give weight to the characters' decisions.

## What You Need to Play
*   A set of polyhedral dice (or a digital roller).
*   Character sheets.
*   A setting (either from the [Settings](../settings/) folder or your own creation).
*   Friends to tell a story with.
