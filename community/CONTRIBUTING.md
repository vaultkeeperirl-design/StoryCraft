# Contributing to StoryCraft

We love seeing the StoryCraft universe expand! Whether you have a new setting, a specialized expansion, or just some homebrew rules, here's how you can contribute.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute
1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Create a new branch** for your feature (e.g., `feature/wild-west-setting`).
3.  **Add your content** following the established folder structure.
4.  **Submit a Pull Request** with a clear description of your changes.

## 📝 Style Guidelines
*   Use **Markdown** for all text documents.
*   Keep rules consistent with the [Core Engine](../core-engine/).
*   Use clear, gender-neutral language (they/them).

## 🏘️ Homebrew vs. Official
*   **Homebrew**: Place your custom rules or settings in the `community/homebrew` folder.
*   **Core Proposals**: If you want to suggest a change to the Core Engine, please open an **Issue** first to discuss it with the maintainers.
