**Learning:** Foundational skill systems require predictable math to ensure scalability across settings.
**Action:** Implemented a fixed-rank system (Untrained +0, Trained +2, Expert +4, Master +6). This ensures that characters from a Fantasy setting (e.g., Swordsmanship) and a Sci-Fi setting (e.g., Piloting) operate on the same mathematical scale, allowing for cross-genre compatibility without breaking the Difficulty Class (DC) curve.
