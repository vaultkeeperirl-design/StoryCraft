## 2024-05-22 - Standardizing Skill Progression
**Learning:** Foundational skill systems require predictable math to ensure scalability across settings.
**Action:** Implemented a fixed-rank system (Untrained +0, Trained +2, Expert +4, Master +6). This ensures that characters from a Fantasy setting (e.g., Swordsmanship) and a Sci-Fi setting (e.g., Piloting) operate on the same mathematical scale, allowing for cross-genre compatibility without breaking the Difficulty Class (DC) curve.

## 2024-05-23 - Standardizing Difficulty Classes
**Learning:** Without a unified DC scale, module compatibility breaks down (e.g., a "Hard" lock in Sci-Fi might be trivial compared to a "Hard" enchantment in Fantasy).
**Action:** Codified a universal DC ladder (5/10/15/20/25/30) and Circumstantial Modifiers (Advantage/Disadvantage) to replace arbitrary flat bonuses. This ensures that a DC 15 check has the same statistical weight regardless of the setting.

## 2024-05-24 - Standardizing Attribute Generation
**Learning:** The Core Engine listed Attributes (Might, Agility, Intellect, Will) but lacked a method to generate them, leaving a critical gap in character creation.
**Action:** Implemented three standard Attribute Arrays (Standard, Specialist, Versatile) and an Attribute Scale (-1 to +5). This ensures all characters start with a mathematically balanced baseline while allowing for different playstyles (well-rounded vs. focused), eliminating the randomness of rolling for stats which can break the DC curve.

## 2024-05-25 - Streamlining Conflict Resolution
**Learning:** Opposed rolls for every attack slow down combat significantly and create variable Difficulty Classes that are hard to predict.
**Action:** Implemented a Static Defense system (10 + Agility + Modifiers) to replace opposed rolls for standard attacks. This aligns combat with the Core Check formula (Roll vs DC), speeds up gameplay, and allows players to roll all attacks, keeping the focus on their actions.
