## 2024-05-22 - Standardizing Skill Progression
**Learning:** Foundational skill systems require predictable math to ensure scalability across settings.
**Action:** Implemented a fixed-rank system (Untrained +0, Trained +2, Expert +4, Master +6). This ensures that characters from a Fantasy setting (e.g., Swordsmanship) and a Sci-Fi setting (e.g., Piloting) operate on the same mathematical scale, allowing for cross-genre compatibility without breaking the Difficulty Class (DC) curve.

**Learning:** Without a unified DC scale, module compatibility breaks down (e.g., a "Hard" lock in Sci-Fi might be trivial compared to a "Hard" enchantment in Fantasy).
**Action:** Codified a universal DC ladder (5/10/15/20/25/30) and Circumstantial Modifiers (Advantage/Disadvantage) to replace arbitrary flat bonuses. This ensures that a DC 15 check has the same statistical weight regardless of the setting.
