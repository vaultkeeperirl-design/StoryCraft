# StoryCraft Settings

Settings are "plug-ins" for the StoryCraft Core Engine. While the Core Engine provides the mechanics, the Settings provide the context, flavor, and specialized rules.

## 🌌 Available Settings

*   🧙 [**Fantasy**](./fantasy/): High magic, ancient ruins, and epic quests.
*   🚀 [**Sci-Fi**](./sci-fi/): Galactic empires, cybernetics, and the unknown reach of space.
*   🏙️ [**Modern**](./modern/): Urban legends, secret agents, and street-level heroes.

## 🛠️ How to Use a Setting
1.  Review the [Core Engine](../core-engine/) rules.
2.  Choose a Setting.
3.  Apply the setting-specific rules (such as Magic systems or Tech levels) to your character and world.
