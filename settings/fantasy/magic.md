# Fantasy Magic System

Magic in StoryCraft is a powerful but draining force. Whether it comes from ancient tomes or divine favor, all magic follows the same fundamental rules.

## The Foundations

### 1. New Skills
The Fantasy Setting adds two new skills to the Core Skill List:

*   **Arcana (Intellect)**: Knowledge of magical theory, reading runes, and casting arcane spells. (Used by Wizards, Sorcerers).
*   **Faith (Will)**: Connection to a deity, understanding religious texts, and channeling divine power. (Used by Clerics, Paladins).

### 2. Mana
Magic requires mental energy, represented by **Mana**.
*   **Maximum Mana**: `Character Level + Casting Attribute Modifier` (Intellect for Arcana, Will for Faith).
*   **Recovery**: You regain all expended Mana after a **Long Rest** (8 hours).

*Example: A Level 1 Wizard with +3 Intellect has 4 Mana.*

### 3. Casting Spells
To cast a spell, you must:
1.  Have at least one hand free to gesture or hold a focus (staff, holy symbol).
2.  Speak the incantation clearly.
3.  Spend the required **Mana Cost**.

**The Casting Check:**
Most spells require a **Spell Attack Roll**:
`[Attribute] + [Skill Bonus] + 1d20`
**vs.**
**Target's Defense** (for attacks) or **Standard DC** (for environmental effects).

*   **Concentration**: Some spells require focus to maintain. If you take damage while concentrating, make a **Will Check (DC 10 or half damage taken, whichever is higher)**. On a failure, the spell ends. You can only concentrate on one spell at a time.

## Spell Tiers

### Cantrips (Rank 0)
*   **Cost**: 0 Mana.
*   **Description**: Simple magical effects that have become second nature. They can be cast indefinitely but are less powerful than true spells.

### Spells (Rank 1+)
*   **Cost**: Equal to the Spell's Rank (e.g., Rank 1 Spell = 1 Mana).
*   **Description**: Powerful effects that drain the caster's reserves.
